# 1. Introduction

On March 17, 2020 President Trump referred to the Coronavirus as the "China Virus." Shortly after, the number of anti-Chinese incidents started to increase across the United States. One aspect of public health that is often thrown to the wayside is how influential public officials and leaders are in disseminating public health information. Moreover, not only can their words change the public's views on a health matter but it can also shift a nation's perspective on someone's identity. _[ADD SOME BACKGROUND LITERATURE THAT BACKS THIS CLAIM UP]_ In addition, given the influence of identity politics we may expect the term "China Virus" to be more polarizing to certain identities and states. _[ADD BACKGROUND LITERATURE + IDENTIFY SUBJECTS OF INTEREST]_. There are fewer studies devoted to analyzing these aspects of the pandemic. 


Thus,our project aims to explore the relationship and variability of interest in the term "China Virus" across states through  political, demographic and COVID-19 characteristics. We ask the question, _[INSERT OUR RESERACH QUESTION]_ ?  In order to answer this question, we look to gain a better understanding of _[INSERT NAME OF BAYESIAN METHODOLOGY]_. Ultimately, we hope our research inspires others to explore and better understand the impact langauge and words have on the public during times of crisis.
